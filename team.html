                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;After a degree in Business administration and the prestigious CEMS Master in International Management that he attained studying at HKUST, 
                                                Alessandro is currently working towards a PhD in Consumer Behavior - Marketing at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
                                                In applying for his PhD he was awarded the highly coveted HKPFS scholarship. He speaks 4 languages and is currently in the process learning an intermediate level of Mandarin Chinese. 
                                                During his life he lived in different countries in Europe and Asia, including but not limited to Italy, China, France and Austria.

                                                </br>
                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Alessandro worked as a tutor for GMAT and GRE exams, developing a strong expertise in the college admission processes worldwide and in advising his students in the most efficient ways to bring their applications up to a level beyond what they may have archived themselves.
                                                He has helped students to get admitted to INSEAD, Yale University, HEC Paris and other top institutions. Not only is Alessandro an expert in aiding students to develop their narrative, but also in defining their leadership skills and their extracurricular profiles.
                                                He strongly believes there is nothing as rewarding as watching a student gain confidence in their skills and succeeding in the college admissions process.
